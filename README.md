# TigerAI n8n Skill Pack — User Manual

> 🌐 **English** | [繁體中文](README.zh.md)

> Describe what you want in plain language (like talking to a coworker), and AI generates a complete n8n workflow for you.
> No coding required.

![TigerAI n8n Skill Pack — full pipeline diagram](docs/images/tigerai-flow-en.png)

> 📊 **The whole pack in one picture**: User writes yellow sticky notes (Layer 1 intent) → TigerAI Skill Pack brain (Cookbook + 2,061 reference workflows + DSL v1.2 + 12 skills + 4 enterprise patterns) → Three-layer workflow JSON (real n8n workflow). Three features, zero learning curve.

## 🤖 This is an Agentic Engineering Example

> **This entire project was authored using AI Agentic IDEs (Antigravity / Claude Code) — from spec to n8n workflows, every artifact was produced through human-AI agent collaboration.**

This Skill Pack is itself a working demo of **Agentic Engineering**:

| Dimension | Traditional way | This project (Agentic) |
|---|---|---|
| **Spec writing** | Engineer types every word | Chat with AI → AI produces SDD (Spec-Driven Design) |
| **n8n workflow dev** | Drag nodes on canvas | Write a yellow sticky note → AI emits runnable JSON |
| **Skill / plugin authoring** | Read docs, copy templates | Claude Code Skills + Antigravity `.agent/workflows/` orchestration |
| **Acceptance testing** | Run cases by hand, write report | AI runs 8 scenarios → auto-emits [`tests/REPORT-3.en.md`](tests/REPORT-3.en.md) |
| **Docs / README / CHANGELOG** | Backfilled after coding | Generated alongside code |
| **Third-party license compliance** | Manual review | AI detects leaked secrets, scrubs them, generates `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` |

### Agentic footprints in this repo

- **`skills/`** — 13 Claude Code / Antigravity skills; each `SKILL.md` is co-authored by humans and AI
- **`.agent/workflows/`** — Antigravity-native agentic workflows (e.g. `/install-n8n-pack` one-shot installer)
- **`cookbook/`** — 8 natural-language → workflow examples showing how to "talk to" the AI
- **`spec/sticky-note-three-layer.md`** — Three-layer structure spec that forces reviewable AI output
- **`research/patterns.md`** — 7 canonical skeletons + anti-patterns mined by AI from 2,061 real workflows
- **`reference-workflows/`** — AI training corpus ([Zie619/n8n-workflows](https://github.com/Zie619/n8n-workflows), MIT, secrets scrubbed)

### Who should study this project

- Developers / PMs learning **how to use an AI agent as an engineering teammate**
- Teams evaluating **whether Antigravity / Claude Code can replace hand-written skills / workflows**
- Anyone curious **what real human-AI co-authored engineering output looks like**

> 💡 In other words: this isn't just "a Skill Pack for n8n" — it's also an open **case study of how AI agents build a real product**.

### 👥 You (the user) can build n8n workflows the same way

**Once you install this Skill Pack, you can author your own n8n workflows with the same agentic approach** — no node syntax to learn, no code to write:

| Tool | What you do | What the AI does |
|---|---|---|
| **Antigravity** | Open your n8n project in Antigravity, run `/install-n8n-pack`, then describe what you want in plain language | `.agent/workflows/` auto-reads your intent → emits workflow JSON → deploys via n8n API |
| **Claude Code (CLI / VS Code)** | Run `bash install.sh` (or `install.ps1`) in your working dir, then say "I want a workflow that…" | 13 skills auto-load → three-layer workflow produced → ready to import into n8n |
| **Any AI assistant (ChatGPT / Gemini)** | Paste an example from [`cookbook/`](cookbook/00-INDEX.en.md) as a few-shot prompt | Imitates the three-layer structure and emits a compliant workflow JSON |

**Typical interaction** (30-second mental model):

```text
You ──> AI: "Every weekday 9am, pull Shopify orders, build a daily
             report, email it to the boss; on failure post to Slack #ops"

AI ──> You: ✅ workflow.json generated (Schedule → Shopify → Code → Email + Error → Slack)
             ✅ Yellow sticky: your original requirement, preserved
             ✅ Blue sticky: which credentials, constraints, test method
             ✅ Deployed to your n8n via API, webhook URL: https://...
```

> 🎯 **The core idea**: Users don't need to understand n8n internals — they just need to "talk like a human" to the AI. The Skill Pack ensures the AI's output is spec-compliant, reviewable, and maintainable.

See [`02-USAGE-MODES.en.md`](02-USAGE-MODES.en.md) for the three usage modes and [`03-FIRST-WORKFLOW.en.md`](03-FIRST-WORKFLOW.en.md) for a 15-minute hands-on walkthrough.

## ⚡ Understand it in 90 seconds

### What it does

You drop a **yellow sticky note** on the n8n canvas and write (in any language):

```text
Every day at 9 AM, fetch sales data and email the daily report to my boss.
On failure, notify Slack #ops.
```

You ask AI to build it. The canvas now shows a complete workflow:

```
┌─ Yellow sticky: your requirement (preserved as-is)
├─ Middle: AI-generated nodes (Schedule → HTTP → Code → Email)
└─ Blue sticky: AI's notes (credentials needed, assumptions, limitations, how to test)
```

No code. No syntax to learn. No need to memorize n8n node names.

### Three usage modes (details in [02-USAGE-MODES.en.md](02-USAGE-MODES.en.md))

| Mode | When | Trigger phrase |
|---|---|---|
| 🪄 Cookbook copy | You know what you want, fast | Copy from [cookbook](cookbook/00-INDEX.en.md) |
| 💬 Q&A mode | You have no idea how to describe it | "enable Q&A mode" / "問答模式" |
| 🔍 Example finder | Want to see prior art first | "find examples for X" / "範例查詢" |
