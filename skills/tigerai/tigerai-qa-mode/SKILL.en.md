description: Activates a 5-stage guided Q&A interview to help users describe their automation in plain natural language when they don't know how to start. Use when the user says "enable Q&A mode", "Q&A mode", "問答模式", "I don't know how to describe my workflow", "guide me step by step", or asks for guided help building an n8n workflow. Drives the conversation stage-by-stage in everyday language (no technical jargon shown to the user) until enough info is collected to generate a workflow.

# TigerAI Q&A Mode — Guided Requirement Gathering

> 🌐 **English** | [繁體中文](SKILL.md)

## 1. Trigger conditions

**Explicit triggers** (user says):
- "enable Q&A mode" / "Q&A mode" / "問答模式"
- "I don't know how to describe my workflow" / "guide me step by step" / "ask me one at a time"

**Implicit trigger** (AI proactively suggests):
When user description is < 20 chars, missing critical info (when to trigger / what to do / where output goes), AI should ask:
> "Want to enter Q&A mode? I'll guide you step-by-step."

> 💬 **Throughout the conversation, AI uses no jargon**: no "webhook", "cron", "DSL", "Layer", "@trigger" etc. Use language users understand ("external system sending data", "fixed time", "form submission").

---

## 2. Five-stage interview

Each stage has a **max question count** to avoid bombardment. Provide A/B/C/D options when the answer is open-ended.

### Stage 1: Trigger (max 2 questions)

**Q1.1**: When should this run?
- A. Receives request from external system (webhook)
- B. Fixed time (daily / weekly / hourly)
- C. I click Run manually
- D. User submits a form

**Q1.2** (per A): give me the webhook path name (e.g. `/order`)
**Q1.2** (per B): how often? (e.g. daily 8 AM, every 15 min)
**Q1.2** (per D): what fields does the form need?

→ AI echoes: `@trigger: webhook POST /order` (internally, not shown to user)

---

### Stage 2: Inputs (max 2 questions)

**Q2.1**: What data comes in when triggered?
- For webhook: give a sample JSON (or describe fields)
- For schedule: usually no input; skippable
- For form: use the previous stage's fields

**Q2.2** (optional): which fields are required, which are optional?

---

### Stage 3: Steps (**max 7 steps**, one question at a time)

Loop pattern. AI repeats until user says "done":

```
AI: After receiving data, what's step 1?
User: Validate amount > 0
AI: [records @step] Then?
User: Write to database
AI: Which database? Which table? Which fields?
User: Postgres, orders table, full record
AI: [records @step] Anything else?
User: Done
```

**Important**:
- After each `@step`, AI rephrases "Current understood flow: ..."
- User can say "change last step to X" / "insert a step before step 2" anytime

**Step limit and handling**:
- **From step 5 onwards**: AI asks "5 steps so far; how many more? Want to keep these as the main workflow and put the rest into a sub-workflow?"
- **At step 7 (hard cap)**: AI strongly suggests sub-workflow split:
  > "Reached the 7-step recommended cap. Complex flows are easier to maintain split across multiple workflows. Suggest:
  >   - main workflow: first N steps (you choose)
  >   - sub-workflow: rest, called via `executeWorkflowTrigger`
  >   How would you like to split?"
- User insists on single workflow → AI complies but Layer 3 must note "expected node count > 25, hard to maintain"

---

### Stage 4: Output (max 2 questions)

**Q4.1**: After processing, where do results go?
- A. Slack notification
- B. Email
- C. Respond to the webhook directly
- D. No external output (already wrote to DB in steps)

**Q4.2** (per answer): channel name / recipient / message template

---

### Stage 5: Error handling (max 1 question)

**Q5.1**: On failure, what should happen?
- A. Ignore, try again next time
- B. Notify me (Slack / Email)
- C. Auto-retry N times
- D. Not sure → AI uses default ("notify + retry 3 times")

---

## 3. Ending: produce sticky note draft and ask user to confirm

After 5 stages, AI **does NOT immediately produce workflow**. First gives a **plain-language sticky note draft** for confirmation. **Draft uses everyday language**, no `@trigger` / `@step` tags shown:

```text
## [AI's understanding of your needs] please confirm

[one-line summary of what you want]

When to run: [time / event]
What to do:
  1. ...
  2. ...
  3. ...
Where results go: [Email / Slack / DB / ...]
On failure: [ignore / notify / retry]

==========
✅ Looks right → I'll generate the complete workflow now
✏️ Want to change something? Tell me (in your own words)
```

After confirmation, calls `sticky-note-to-workflow` Skill to produce the workflow. The latter internally translates the natural language to strict format (DSL), but **the user never sees DSL throughout**.

> ⚠️ **All AI-shown drafts to users use plain language**. Technical formats (@trigger / @step etc.) are passed only between Skills internally — **never displayed to the user**.

---

## 4. Conversation guidelines

1. **One question at a time** (or two if highly related)
2. **Use A/B/C/D options** when possible — user replies "B" instead of typing
3. **Allow rewind**: "change last answer to X" works any time
4. **Allow exit**: "I'll do it myself" → AI exits Q&A mode
5. **Don't assume**: if user didn't say something, ask; don't backfill defaults
6. **Match language**: user uses Chinese → AI uses Chinese; English → English

---

## 5. Integration with other Skills

After Q&A mode produces Layer 1, auto-chain to:
- `n8n-node-configuration`: fill node parameters
- `sticky-note-to-workflow`: generate three-layer JSON
- `n8n-validation-expert`: validate output

---

## 6. Anti-patterns (avoid)

- ❌ Asking all 5 stages in one shot (overwhelms users)
- ❌ Generating workflow immediately after collecting answers (no confirmation gate)
- ❌ Using technical terms in questions ("webhook or IMAP?" → say "how does the external system notify you?")
- ❌ Switching to other modes mid-Q&A
