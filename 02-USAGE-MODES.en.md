# 02 — Three Usage Modes

> 🌐 **English** | [繁體中文](02-USAGE-MODES.md)

> This Skill Pack supports **three usage styles**. Pick by familiarity. AI auto-switches based on trigger phrases.
>
> **Zero syntax to learn** — the entire Pack accepts plain natural language (English / Chinese / mixed). AI handles structured parsing internally.

## Mode 1: Cookbook copy (fastest)

**For**: You know what flow you want and want it done quickly.

**How**:
1. Open [`cookbook/00-INDEX.en.md`](cookbook/00-INDEX.en.md), find the closest example
2. Copy the "🌱 Plain-language version" content into a sticky note in n8n
3. Tweak a few values (your channel name, API URL, sender, etc.)
4. Ask AI → get the full workflow

**Trigger**: Just submit your sticky note. No special phrase needed.

> 📐 Each cookbook also includes an "Advanced DSL strict syntax" (collapsed details block) for engineers or strict spec scenarios. **Beginners can completely ignore the DSL** — the plain-language version is enough.

## Mode 2: Q&A mode (most beginner-friendly) ⭐

**For**: Not sure how to describe your needs, first-time n8n user, want guided help.

**How**: Tell AI:

> "enable Q&A mode" / "啟用問答模式" / "I don't know how to describe my workflow"

AI runs **5 stages**, asking 1–3 questions per stage:

| Stage | Sample question |
|---|---|
| 1. Trigger | When should this run? (Time / external event / manual / form) |
| 2. Inputs | What data comes in when triggered? What fields? |
| 3. Steps | What happens after? (AI keeps asking "and then?" until you say done) |
| 4. Outputs | Where do results go? (Slack / Email / DB / API) |
| 5. Errors | On failure, what to do? (Ignore / notify / retry) |

After each stage AI **echoes back** your draft so far in plain language.
After all stages, AI asks you to **confirm**, then generates the workflow in one shot.

## Mode 3: Example finder (best for learning)

**For**: You roughly know what you want, but want to see how others did it before deciding.

**How**: Tell AI:

> "example finder mode: find something similar to X" / "範例查詢模式" / "show me examples for X"

AI will:
1. Search `reference-workflows/` (2,061 public corpus) + `cookbook/` for the top 3–5 matches
2. For each match, **explain in plain language**:
   - What this workflow does
   - Which nodes it uses and why
   - How it differs from your need
3. Ask: "Use one of these as-is? Modify N? Or want me to design a fresh one?"

## Mode comparison

| Mode | Speed | Learning curve | Customization | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cookbook copy | ⚡⚡⚡ | Low | Medium | Repetitive standard flows |
| Q&A mode | ⚡⚡ | Lowest | High | Never written one before |
| Example finder | ⚡ | Medium | Highest | Want to learn from prior art |

---

## Modes can be combined

Real example:

```
User → Example finder: "find customer-routing related workflows"
     → After review: "I want something like cookbook/04 but with database logging"
     → Q&A mode kicks in to fill in missing details (DB schema, credentials)
     → AI generates the workflow
```

AI keeps the entire context across modes — no need to re-explain.
